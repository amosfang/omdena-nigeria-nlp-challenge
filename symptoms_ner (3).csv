early labor signs,"Lightening occurs when your baby drops inside your pelvis. You may feel increased pressure in your pelvis. This may happen a few weeks to a few hours before your labor begins. Contractions are cramps and tightening that occur in your uterus to help move the baby through your birth canal. Contractions occur regularly and more often each time. Each one lasts about 30 to 70 seconds, and gets stronger until you deliver your baby. Contractions do not go away with movement. The pain usually starts in your lower back and moves to your abdomen. Effacement occurs when your cervix softens and thins, so it can easily open for the baby. You will not be able to feel effacement. Your healthcare provider will examine your cervix for effacement. Dilation is widening of your cervix. Your healthcare provider will examine your cervix for dilation. Your cervix may start to dilate weeks before your baby is delivered. Your cervix will be fully opened and ready for delivery when it is dilated to 10 centimeters. Increased discharge from your vagina may occur. It may be brown, pink, clear, or slightly bloody. This discharge may also be called bloody show. Bloody show is a mucus plug that forms and blocks your cervix during pregnancy. The discharge may mean that your cervix is opening up and getting ready for delivery. Rupture of membranes is a sudden release of clear fluid from your vagina. Ruptured membranes means your water broke.

methamphetamine use disorder,"Signs and symptoms include at least 2 of the following in a 12-month period: You have a strong urge or craving for meth. This is also called addiction. You are not able to control when you use it or how much you use. You spend large amounts of time trying to get, use, or recover from meth. In between uses, you think about when you will get to use it again. You become tolerant to meth. This means the amount you have been using no longer has the effects you want. You need higher amounts to feel the effects. You become dependent on meth. Dependence means your body becomes used to meth. You have withdrawal symptoms when you do not use meth for a short amount of time. You have to use it to stop or prevent withdrawal symptoms, such as shaky hands. You are not able to stop, or to use less. You start again when you try to quit. You try to use lower amounts or to use it less often, but you are not able. You continue to use meth even though it causes problems or is dangerous. For example, try to make the effect stronger by mixing it with alcohol or other drugs. You have problems at school, work, or home. You spend less time doing important or enjoyable activities. You may become violent or impulsive (acting without thinking about the risks). Meth use can also lead to health problems, such as the following:
Heart weakness or damage can develop because meth increases blood pressure and heart rate.
Skin problems may develop if you start picking at your skin or do not care for needle marks. Skin picking causes sores to grow, and the sores can get infected. Meth injection causes needle marks on your skin. Needle marks can also get infected.
Dry mouth can develop and make you chew, clench, or grind your teeth more than normal. This causes your teeth to wear down. Your teeth may turn dark or black. They may break, crumble, or fall apart.

refractive errors of the eye,"The most common symptom is blurry vision. You may rub, shut, or cover one eye, squint, or tilt or turn your head often. You may also have eye strain, headache, or fatigue. You may have other symptoms based on your type of refractive error: Astigmatism means the cornea does not have the normal round shape. The irregular curves makes the eye shaped more like a spoon or football. Astigmatism may be present at birth and may happen along with hyperopia or myopia. Astigmatism causes both near and far objects to appear as deformed images. Straight lines may appear wavy. Hyperopia is also called hypermetropia, or farsightedness. Hyperopia occurs when the eyeball is too short or the cornea is a little flat or less curved. This causes light rays entering the eye to focus behind the retina. Hyperopia causes distant objects to be seen clearly, but close or near objects are blurred. Myopia is also known as nearsightedness. Myopia usually occurs between 5 to 15 years of age. The eyeball is too long or the cornea is too curved or rounded. This causes the light rays to focus in front of the retina. Myopia causes close objects to look clear, but far objects are blurred. Presbyopia is common in adults 40 years or older. Presbyopia happens when the lens becomes stiff and less flexible. This causes the lens to lose its ability to bend or change shape. The lens cannot move and is not able to bring nearby objects into focus. Presbyopia prevents objects from being clear up close. You may need to hold reading material at arm's length in order to read it. Esotropia is a form of strabismus, also called squint or cross-eyed, where the eyes may not be aligned. One eye may turn inward while the other focuses normally. Your eyes do not look in the same direction at the same time. Anisometropia happens when you have different bending power between the 2 eyes.
